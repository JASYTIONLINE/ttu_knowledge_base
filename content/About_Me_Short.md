## Who am I? 

Organizations today are expected to deliver results faster, leaner, and with fewer resources. Leaders are handed teams and missions that stretch across functions, and they’re asked to integrate new technologies while keeping operations running smoothly. The pressure to succeed is constant.  

I know that pressure because I’ve lived it. For more than three decades in federal service, the Army National Guard, and private industry, I’ve been in environments where the mission had to succeed — where failure wasn’t an option. In those roles, I learned how to simplify the complex, align cross-functional teams, and turn big, moving parts into actionable plans.  

I’ve led large-scale operations with thousands of people, built resiliency and risk-reduction programs from the ground up, and introduced **Generative AI solutions** that gave decision-makers clarity they didn’t have before. My approach is always the same: identify the obstacles, provide a clear path forward, and deliver outcomes that hold up under pressure.  

If you’re facing the challenge of guiding your organization through complexity, scaling teams, or making new technology actually work in practice, I bring tested experience and proven strategies to help you move from uncertainty to results.
