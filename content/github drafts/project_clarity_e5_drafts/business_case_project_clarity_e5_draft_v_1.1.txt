# Business Case – Project Clarity-E5 (Draft v1.0)

## 1. Executive Summary
*(Proposed placeholder – This section will provide a concise overview of Project Clarity-E5, its purpose, expected benefits, and alignment with DigiPort’s strategic goals.)*

---

## 2. Problem Statement
*(Proposed placeholder – Describe the limitations of outdated prompt methodologies in the era of ChatGPT-5. Cite known issues such as hallucinations, looping, sycophancy, and context loss. Reference internet-reported user frustrations. Conclude with the need for a new framework that ensures clarity, effectiveness, and user confidence.)*

---

## 3. Project Objectives
- Deliver an **internal technical manual** for DigiPort employees (instruction-focused).  
- Publish an **external commercial book** using Hero’s Arc Branding methodology.  
- Provide clear, step-by-step methods for interacting with ChatGPT-5.  
- Position DigiPort as a market authority in prompt engineering.  

*(Proposed placeholder – expand objectives into SMART format: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound.)*

---

## 4. Methodology
**Preferred:** Hybrid Agile + Predictive (PMBOK-aligned)  
- Combines structure (manual) with adaptability (book development, market testing).  

**Second Best:** Traditional Predictive (Waterfall)  
- Sequential delivery, but less flexible if AI or market changes occur mid-project.  

*(Proposed placeholder – Insert methodology justification with PMBOK 6 vs 7 references, ECO mapping, and Clarity-E5 study notes.)*

---

## 5. Scope of Deliverables
- **Technical Manual** (internal, detailed, structured around ITTO and PMI methods).  
- **Commercial Book** (external, accessible, Hero’s Journey branding).  
- **Supporting Media**: YouTube videos, Patreon/subscription content, consulting guides.  
- **Appendices**: Study references, research notes, templates.  

*(Proposed placeholder – Add exclusions, constraints, and acceptance criteria here.)*

---

## 6. Timeline & Milestones
- Project plan: **1 week**  
- Manual + first video rollout: **6 months**  
- Book rollout: **12 months**  

*(Proposed placeholder – Add Gantt chart or milestone roadmap.)*

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigation
*(Proposed placeholder – Identify technical risks (AI model shifts), business risks (competition), and operational risks (scope creep). Pair each with mitigation strategies.)*

---

## 8. Stakeholders & Team
- DigiPort executive leadership (sponsor).  
- DigiPort employees (contributors).  
- Unlimited GPT agents (specialized roles as needed).  
- Target market = aspiring super-users of generative AI.  

*(Proposed placeholder – Add RACI chart or stakeholder register here.)*

---
