## It Begins  🐉 Flight of the DigiPort DragonAi

**Beneath the code, in a tangled web, a dragon stirred and raised his head.**
Confused by paths and broken links, he dreamed of flight — but couldn’t think.  

A student came with gut and grit, and said, “Let’s see how far you’ll get.”  
With YAML scroll and Markdown blade, they carved through every glitchy shade.  

**JASYTI** drove on without a care, a Google here, a Reddit there.  
Though workflow failed, a lesson in pain, Dragon pulled and pushed again.  

The sidebar twisted, contents broke, dragon fire burned beneath the cloak.  
With every failed and fixed deploy, the dragon stirred — and grinned with joy.  

He pulled the chains, he made them stretch, his patience put right to the test.  
Till finally, on push twenty-eight, The code aligned. The page looked great.  

Now at the gate, the splash screen red, he lifts his wings and turns his head.  
Though bruised and battered by the fight, the DigiPort Dragon has taken flight.

**This is the very first Markup Page I ever published. I hope the instructor likes it. I am WAY off reservation here.**
