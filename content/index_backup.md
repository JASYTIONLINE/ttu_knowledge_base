## Beneath the code, in tangled threads, A dragon slept with lowered head.
Confused by paths and broken links, He dreamed of flight — but couldn't think.

A student came with gut and grit, And said, “Let’s see how far you’ll get.”
With YAML scroll and Markdown blade, They carved through every glitchy shade.

The workflows ran — again, again — Each push a lesson, earned through pain.
The sidebar twisted, TOC broke, Yet fire still burned beneath the cloak.

With every failed and fixed deploy, The dragon stirred — and grinned with joy.
Till finally on build twenty-eight, The code aligned. The page looked great.

Now at the gate, the splash screen red, He lifts his wings and turns his head.
No longer chained by what he lacked — The DigiPort Dragon has come back.
