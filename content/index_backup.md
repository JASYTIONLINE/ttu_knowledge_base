## It Begins

## 🐉 Flight of the DigiPort DragonAi

### Beneath the code, in a tangled web,  
A dragon stirred and raised his head.  
Confused by paths and broken links,  
He dreamed of flight — but couldn’t think.  

A student came with gut and grit,  
And said, “Let’s see how far you’ll get.”  
With YAML scroll and Markdown blade,  
They carved through every glitchy shade.  

**JASYTI** drove on without a care —  
A Google here, a Reddit there.  
The workflows failed again and again;  
Each push a lesson, earned through pain.  

The sidebar twisted, contents broke,  
But dragon fire burned beneath the cloak.  
With every failed and fixed deploy,  
The dragon stirred — and grinned with joy.  

He pulled the chains, he made them stretch,  
His patience put right to the test.  
Till finally, on build twenty-eight,  
The code aligned. The page looked great.  

Now at the gate, the splash screen red,  
He lifts his wings and turns his head.  
Though bruised and battered by the fight —  
The DigiPort Dragon has taken flight.
