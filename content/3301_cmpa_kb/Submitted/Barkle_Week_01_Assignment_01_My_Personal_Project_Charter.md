# John E. Barkle IV

## Course Goals
1. **Finish this semester with a 4.0 GPA.** That means turning in every assignment, discussion, and project on time and hitting the top of each rubric. I’m also working toward my Network+ certification and completing the first half of my full-stack bootcamp. By the end of the semester, I want to have the skills—and the confidence—to start building the ideas I’ve had in my head for years.

2. **Execute my semester plan (Project 330X) as a real-world PMI-aligned project.** When I started this course, I decided to use it as a real-world exercise in preparing myself for the PMI Project Management Professional (PMP) certification exam. I’ve created a full project plan that includes a charter, stakeholder register, scope statement, risk management plan, communications plan, and other PMI-required documents. Success means completing a full set of 30 project management artifacts—everything from...

3. **Meet 100% of my personal and academic commitments this term.** This term, I want to bring order to my personal chaos. At work, my life is structured—I use tools like Outlook, execution checklists, and automation systems to manage projects, hit deadlines, and succeed. But in my personal life, it’s a different story. This semester, I’m applying those same project management principles to my own life—health, fitness, and academics included. My goal is simple: to meet 100% of my commitments to stakeho...

4. **Go live with a full-stack website and start building real-world solutions.** I want to start turning my ideas into real-world working solutions. This semester, that means completing the first half of my full-stack bootcamp, passing my Network+ certification exam, and going live with a fully functional front-end and back-end website to start hosting the many different ideas I have for revenue streams.

## Potential Challenges
- **Mental fatigue and loss of momentum mid-semester** — mitigated by sticking to my project plan, which includes clearly defined executables, deadlines, and outlines a manageable work schedule allowing me to accomplish the goals I’ve set for myself.
- **Falling behind on assignments due to external obligations** — mitigated by creating a rigid execution checklist that spells out everything I need to do this semester to meet both academic and personal responsibilities.
- **Technology issues or platform downtime** — mitigated by investing in a highly reliable computer that can handle the workload, keeping a backup laptop on standby, maintaining two forms of internet connectivity, and submitting assignments early whenever possible to build in buffer time for technical difficulties.
- **Compressed schedules across multiple courses and certifications** — mitigated by intensive pre-semester planning, blocking dedicated time for each obligation—including personal rest, relaxation, and reset—and reserving Saturdays to catch up on any backlog so that nothing is rushed on Sunday.
- **Difficulty managing overlapping project scopes** — mitigated by creating and actively managing the Project 330X plan, which integrates deliverables across all platforms into a single, comprehensive academic strategy.
